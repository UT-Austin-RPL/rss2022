As the conference will be held on the Columbia University campus, all in-person attendees will have to adhere to the [Columbia University Covid-19 policies for visitors](https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/visitor-guidelines-spring-2022). In particular, this means that **all in-person attendees will have to show proof of vaccination** with a primary series (defined as two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, a single dose of the J&J vaccine, or any approved [WHO combination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#recommendations)).  Acceptable proof will include a CDC card, Excelsior Pass, or documentation from an attendee's home country. If a document from an attendee's home country is not in English, it will have to be accompanied by a certified English translation.

In addition, **masks will be mandatory for all plenary sessions and poster sessions**.

Please note that these guidelines are subject to change, based on the situation in New York City, local and federal guidelines, and Columbia university policies.

With the support of all of our community members, we can work to reduce the risk of exposure and infection, but we cannot eliminate it. All conference participants assume the risks associated with participation in the conference.
