RSS 2021 will be held using a central virtual conference platform to
host all live events, allow users to flexibly join all workshops,
paper discussion sessions, the plenary sessions, interact with each
other and sponsors, and manage attendees.

Registration fees will be US $20 for students, and US$ 50 for
non-students, and give full access to the virtual conference platform,
including the workshop and main conference events.

The registration costs shown above are in US dollars ($). Contact Florian Shkurti (florian@cs.toronto.edu) if you encounter problems. 

We have reserved a number of beds in dorm-style rooms in the Columbia University dorm system. These must be reserved for the entire duration of the conference (6 nights, 6/26-7/2). The total cost for this duration will be $490. Please note that a majority of these beds will be in double-occupancy rooms (single-gender). These rooms will be within a short walking distance of Columbia's Morningside campus, where the conference will take place.
