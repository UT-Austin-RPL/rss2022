We are pleased to announce the 18th edition of the Robotics: Science and Systems Conference to be held in New York City in summer of 2022. RSS is a single-track conference that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format gives attendees an opportunity to see state-of-the-art research in all areas of robotics, and will consist of oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, invited talks, and panels.

The conference will preserve the RSS tradition of selecting excellent papers via a thorough and fair review process. Paper submissions will be evaluated in terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and clarity.

RSS also features a series of vibrant and engaging workshops across a diverse range of topics. RSS workshops are a highlight of the conference and offer participants an opportunity to discuss bleeding-edge topics in depth with renowned experts.


## Important Dates

* January 28, 2022: Paper Submission Deadline
* February 18th, 2022: Workshop Submission Deadline
* March 4, 2022: Workshop Acceptance Notification
* April 15, 2022: Paper Acceptance Notification
* June 27 - July 1, 2022: RSS 2022, New York City, USA

Detailed submission instructions are available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/information/authorinfo/).


## Subject Areas 

RSS seeks high-quality research papers that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics. We invite submissions in all areas of robotics, including: mechanisms and design, robot learning, control and dynamics, planning, manipulation, field robotics, human-robot interaction, perception, formal methods, multi-robot systems, healthcare and medical robotics, bioinspired robots, and mobile robotics.


## Highlights of RSS 2022

* After two years of virtual conferences due to the Coronavirus pandemic, RSS 2022 is planned as a hybrid conference with substantial in-person activities! We are closely monitoring the developing COVID-19 situation and will make further determinations about the distribution of in-person vs virtual activities as we get closer to the conference date.

* The 2022 program committee consists of a set of [Area Chairs]({{site.baseurl}}/committees/pc) with broad and deep expertise across all sub-disciplines of robotics. The review process will continue RSS's strong tradition in emphasizing care, quality, fairness, and rigor. Reviews will be double-blind, and authors will be allowed to submit a rebuttal to the reviews. Author rebuttals will be directed to the ACs and considered during the program committee meeting.

* To encourage a more balanced consideration of "systems" papers, additional review criteria have been introduced that ask reviewers and Area Chairs to gauge the potential impact of a paper on deployed robotic systems. See the [Open Letter from the Program Chair](https://hauser-kris.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-the-program-chair-of-robotics-science-and-systems-2022-419138fda27d) for more information about the rationale for this change.

* RSS maintains a strong on-going relationship with top robotics journals and authors have been invited in the past to submit papers to [IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ro), and to special issues of the [International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/ijr) and [Autonomous Robots (AuRo)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10514).

## Special Journal Issues

RSS maintains a strong on-going relationship with top robotics journals. 
In 2021, about _half_ of the selected papers will be invited for submission to 
a special issue of International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) and a special issue of Autonomous Robots (AuRo).
As of late 2020, the most recently published special issues with RSS papers are
[International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/ijra/39/2-3) and 
[Autonomous Robots (AuRo)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10514/volumes-and-issues/44-7).

For example, out of the 57 accepted papers in RSS 2014, 15 appeared in the [IJRR Special Issue](http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/35/1-3.toc), and 13 in the [AuRo Special Issue](http://link.springer.com/journal/10514/39/3/page/1).
